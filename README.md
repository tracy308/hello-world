# hello-world

Hello fellow humans!
My name is Tracy, I am generally a beginner in programming, but I am learning C++, C, assembly, and java, most familiar with Java. 
I love solving puzzles at a young age and being exposed to computer science really sparked my interest in the field. hence, I became a CS major 
Compared to my classmates, I feel terrible and I am desparate to become a better programmer. 
Please support my journey to improve myself!
Sorry for wasting your time to read this, and I hope you have a wonderful day! 
Thanks.
